## Description
Bilkent TOYS is a system for guides, advisors, coordinators and directors to communicate, plan and participate in university tours and fairs submitted by high school councelors or students.
## Features
### Form Application Interface for highschools to apply for tours
Highschools can apply through the platform, in which they choose their highschool from a list, choose their timeslot, give their contact information and information about how many students are coming.
### Interface for advisors to manage tours and assign guides
When councelors apply for a tour, advisors choose which tours to accept, and for which timeslot. A guide match algorithm will match the available guides to tours based on their majors and the high schools that they graduated from.
### Guide Interface for guides to join tours and keep track of tours
Guides can apply to be a guide for a specific tour through the interface. They also keep track of their timetables, lectures, and can indicate when they start and end the tours.
### Interface for coordinator to oversee the whole process
The coordinator can promote guides to become advisors, and manage their hourly payment. The coordinator can also process fair applications and assign guides to them.
